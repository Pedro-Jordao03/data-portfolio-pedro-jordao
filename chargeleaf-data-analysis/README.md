# ChargeLeaf – Data Analysis & Business Insights

## Objective
This project analyzes operational and customer data from **ChargeLeaf**, a Portuguese company expanding its network of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.  
The goal was to identify **strategic locations for new charging stations**, analyze **customer satisfaction**, and propose **data-driven actions** to improve performance.

## Tools & Skills
- **Excel** (data cleaning & exploration)
- **Power BI** (data visualization & insights)
- **Data Analysis & Business Intelligence**
- **Analytical reasoning and strategic recommendations**

## Dataset
File: `BD_ChargeLeaf.xlsx`  
Contains anonymized operational data from 2024, including:
- Customer types and geographic distribution  
- Charger types and usage frequency  
- Satisfaction ratings  
- Temporal usage patterns (peak hours)

## Key Findings
- **62% of customers** are private users; **38%** are commercial.  
- **Normal chargers** account for **62.5% of total usage**, while **Fast chargers** represent **34.5%**.  
- Highest customer concentrations: **Lisboa (36%)**, **Porto (30%)**, **Setúbal (15%)**, **Braga (5%)**.  
- **Setúbal** stands out as a strategic location for new stations (high demand, low supply).  
- **Customer satisfaction** averages **2.6**, with critical issues in **Castelo Branco (1.0)**.  
- **Peak demand:** 07h–12h and 16h–21h.

## Recommendations
- Install a **new charging station in Setúbal** to meet growing demand.  
- Introduce **dynamic pricing** to balance usage during off-peak hours.  
- Improve **maintenance response times** to boost satisfaction.  
- Conduct **customer feedback surveys** in low-rated regions.

## Learnings
This project strengthened my skills in:
- Translating business problems into analytical questions.  
- Using data to support strategic decisions.  
- Communicating insights clearly through visual and written reports.
